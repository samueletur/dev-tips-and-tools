[whereBetween with dates](#wherebetween-with-dates) use whereBetween with a range date. If you need to provide fallback you can do so with the nullish coalescing operator ?? `#whereBetween` `#date`

### **allRelatedIds**

### **Sensitive Data**

If we want to put "sensitive" data in our DB then we can use Crypt Facade and handle these using accessors and mutators.

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Cast\Attribute;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Crypt;

class Client extends Model
{
    protected function document(): Attribute
    {
        return Attribute::make(
            set: fn ($value) => Crypt::encryptString($value),
            get: fn ($value) => Crypt::decryptString($value),
        );
    }
}
```

### **When for conditionally situations**

For situations where you need to conditionally build up a database query e.g. if published = true, then add a WHERE statement… make use of the ‘when’ method directly on the query builder. It’s great for keeping things neat and chained.

```php

// instead of
$query = Article::query();

if($published)
    $query = $query->where('published',true);

return $query->get();

// you can use
    return Article::query()
        ->when($published, fn($query) => $query->where('published',true))
        ->get();
```

### **whereBelongsTo**

Get relationship without use where on query

```php
// instead of
Order::where('user_id',$user->id)->sum('total_amount');

// you can use
Order::whereBelongsTo($user)->sum('total_amount');
```

### **wherebetween with dates**

How to retrieve records between two timestamps in Laravel 🗓  Use whereBetween with a from and to date. If you need to provide fallback you can do so with the nullish coalescing operator

```php
Post::whereBetween('publish_at', [
    $request->from ?? '1970-01-01',
    $request->to ?? today()->toDateTimeString()
])->get();
```
